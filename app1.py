The Multiple Plant Disease Detection System leverages cutting-edge deep learning techniques to accurately identify plant diseases through image analysis. Using a fine-tuned MobileNetV2 model, this system is designed to help farmers, agricultural experts, and plant enthusiasts quickly diagnose plant diseases and take timely action. The goal is to reduce crop losses, promote sustainable farming practices, and assist in early disease detection.

#### Key Features
* __Accurate Disease Detection:__  Identifies diseases in plant leaves from a variety of crops including apples, corn, tomatoes, and more.\n
* __User-Friendly Interface:__  Easily upload images of plant leaves to get real-time disease predictions.\n
* __Machine Learning Model:__  Built using a fine-tuned MobileNet V2 model, trained on a large dataset of plant leaf images.\n
* __Multiple Crop Support:__  Capable of detecting diseases in various crops with 19 distinct classes.\n
                      
#### Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to:

__1. Support Farmers:__ Provide a cost-effective solution for early disease detection.\n
__2. Improve Crop Yield:__ Reduce the time between disease occurrence and identification.\n
__3. Promote Sustainability:__ Encourage efficient resource use by targeting specific diseases.\n
                    
#### Technology Stack
* __Deep Learning Framework:__ TensorFlow and Keras for model training and inference.\n
* __Model Architecture:__ MobileNet V2, a powerful convolutional neural network for image classification.\n
* __Frontend Interface:__ Designed with a user-friendly layout for easy interaction.\n
* __Programming Language:__ Python, used for both model development and deployment.\n
* __Optimization:__ Early stopping and model checkpointing to ensure the best performance during training.\n

#### About the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a comprehensive collection of plant leaf images categorized into 19 classes, covering both healthy and diseased leaves.\n

Training Images: 35669\n
Validation Images: 8917\n
Test Images: 25 (for performance evaluation) The dataset includes a wide variety of plant diseases and conditions, making it robust for real-world applications.
                            
#### Achieved Accuracy
__I. Training Accuracy: 99.67%__\n
__II. Validation Accuracy: 99.24%__\n
The model achieves excellent results in detecting plant diseases, showcasing the power of deep learning in agriculture.
                    
#### Future Enhancements
__Multi-language Support:__ To cater to users globally, we plan to add multilingual capabilities.\n
__Broader Crop Coverage:__ Adding support for more crops and diseases.\n
__Mobile Application:__ Developing a mobile app for on-the-go disease detection.\n
#### Conclusion
We hope this project inspires innovative solutions in the field of agriculture and plant health. Whether you're a farmer, researcher, or tech enthusiast, this tool is designed to empower you with the power of AI for a better tomorrow.

Together, we can make strides in sustainable farming and secure healthier crops for the future. Thank you for exploring this system, and we look forward to your feedback and ideas to improve and expand its capabilities! üå±
